<h1> Assignment 2 </h1>
<h1>Bubble Breaker</h1>
<h1> Due Date: Feb 10 at 5:00 PM</h1>


<h2> Description </h2>




<p>
In this assignment you will develop a web site for playing Bubble
Breaker. </p>


<p>
Bubble Breaker is a puzzle game that presents the user
with a rectangular playing screen 8 rows high by 15 columns wide
filled randomly with bubbles of 5 different colors (see Figure
1). 
</p>

<p>
The objective of the game is to remove as many bubbles from the screen
as possible while connecting bubbles of the same kind together to
achieve a higher score.
</p>


<p>
To remove a group of 2 or more adjoined bubbles of the same color, a
user first selects the group by clicking on one of the bubbles.  The
application then highlights the set of selected bubbles by surrounding
them with a thin border.  The application also shows how many 
points would be gained by removing the group (see Figure 2).
The total points is determined by the formula <em>n<sup>2</sup></em>, where
n is the number of bubbles in the group.  The user can then remove the
group by clicking a second time on one of the highlighted bubbles;
however, if the user clicks on a bubble that is not in the highlighted
set the original selection is cancelated.  In the later case, when the
user clicks on a bubble that has itself adjoining bubbles of the same
color, the application also highlights the new set of selected
bubbles.

<p>
When bubbles are removed from the screen the usual gravity action
takes place (see Figure 3). A column without any bubbles left is trimmed
away by other columns which slide to the left.

<p>The game ends when all bubbles are cleared from the screen or when
there are no adjoining bubbles of the same color left on the screen
(see Figure 4).

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>
This assignment evaluates the use of client-side Web technologies
including XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM, as well as calling on
provided CGI scripts.  You will use these technologies to provide a
pleasant experience for your Web site.  Do not use Applets for this
assignment and refrain from using server-side programming.  Other than
the provided scripts, everything must happen on the client-side.  Make
sure to use CSS style sheets in favor of deprecated HTML tags and
attributes.  </li>

<li>At any time a user should be able to start a new game.</li>

<li>Your application should show the current score at all times.</li>

<li>Your application should diplay a timer that shows how many seconds
have elapsed since the user started to play.  Reset the timer when
starting a new game.</li>

<li>At the end of a game, your application should ask the user to type
their name.  It will then call on the CGI script <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/courses/csc309/assignments/a2/topScore.pl">topScore.pl</a>, which returns an HTML document
that displays a ranking of all game scores to date.  Your application
should display this ranking to the user.  The script topScore.pl
expects to be called with a URL of the form http://servername:&lt;yourportnumber&gt;/cgi-bin/topScore.pl?name=<em>username</em>&amp;score=<em>numericscore</em>.


<p><b>Note</b>: Consult the Student Guide for
instructions on how to install Apache and run CGI scripts. The script
topScore.pl should run unmodified on cdf; however, to run the script
on your home machine you will have to edit the script to set the path
where perl is installed in your system. Finally, remember to make
topScore.pl executable after you copy it to the cgi-bin
directory.
</p>
</li>


<li> Your application should be easy to use.</li>

<li>The main entry page for your site should be called
<em>index.html</em>.</li>

<li> Make sure your site functions correctly in the CDF
environment.  TAs will not debug so test to ensure it works the first
time! </li>
</ul>




<h2> Deliverables </h2>

<p>

Put all necessary files in one directory, and archive the directory
into a single file using <em>tar</em> or a similar utility. Finally, submit
your assignment using the BlackBoard system.


</p>

<p>
You electronic submission should include the following items:
</p>
   
<ul>
    
<li> Documentation for your Web site (brief explanations
     of how it all works).</li>
<li> CSS file(s).</li>
<li> XHTML file(s).</li>
<li> JavaScript file(s).</li>

</ul>

<p>Do <b>NOT</b> include the provided CGI script with your submission.  You can assume that the TA will have the script available under http://localhost:&lt;TAPort&gt;/cgi-bin/topScore.pl.</p>

 
<p>Finally, all deliverables should be neatly formatted,
readable,and be properly documented .
</p>

<p>
Good luck!
</p>
